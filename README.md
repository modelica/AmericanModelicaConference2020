The 2nd American Modelica Conference ...

# About the Conference
## Important Update: American Modelica Conference converted to Online Conference due to Coronavirus 

The **American Modelica Conference 2020** will be held online from **September 22nd to September 24th** with all times in US Mountain time as our original location in Boulder. It is organized by the [Modelica Association](https://modelica.org/association) and the North American Modelica User Group [NAMUG](http://na.modelica-users.org/).

The Modelica Conference is the main event for users, library developers, tool vendors and researchers to share their knowledge and learn about the latest scientific and industrial progress related to all of the system simulation standards developed and maintained by the Modelica Association, in particular [Modelica](https://modelica.org/), the [Functional Mockup Interface (FMI)](http://www.fmi-standard.org/), the [System Structure and Parameterization (SSP)](https://ssp-standard.org/) standard and the [The Distributed Co-simulation Protocol (DCP)](https://dcp-standard.org/) standard. 

The program will cover modeling of complex physical and cyber-physical systems, as well as tools, for a wide range of research and industrial applications. All contributions are peer-reviewed and selected by the Program Committee. This conference is co-organized by NAMUG, the North American Modelica Users' Group, and the Modelica Association. 

This conference will have one or several conference tracks with presentations of peer-reviewed papers as all Modelica conferences, but it will, in addition, have one track of industrial user-oriented presentations as user meetings by NAMUG have had for the last 5 years, that does not need to be accompanied by a full scientific paper. The abstracts of the presentations will also be peer-reviewed by the conference board. 

We are looking forward to seeing you in Boulder, CO.

Dr. Michael Tiller and Associate Professor Luigi Vanfretti, PhD

General Chair (Ricardo) and Program Chair (Rensselaer Polytechnical Institute)
